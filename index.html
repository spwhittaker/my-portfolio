    <p>Hello, and welcome to my portfolio page. I will fill this in as I have more to fill in on the site.</p>
    <ul>Here is some of the stuff that I've done so far:
        <li>This is the <a href="https://spwhittaker.github.io/html-scrapbook/">HTML Scrapbook</a>, where I first put some HTML together. It looks disgusting, it's helping me to learn</li>
